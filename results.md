Many sportsbooks provides betting opportunities for exact final scores, but some even offer betting opportunies for squares game. Squares game is where the last digit of the score points to a coordinate on a grid and you can bet on points on that grid. Certain scores and their score combinations are more likly than others, so it's prudent to figure out the likelihood of each square, the odds the sportsbook provides to bet on it, and whether it's profitable to place that bet. 


Because some sportsbooks offer better odds than others, it's possible to mix and match sportsbooks to cover more scores/squares to increase chance of profit.
